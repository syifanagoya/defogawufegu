The adjustment from the immediacy of the live stage to the discipline of the recording studio was an educational process that gave DeGraw new insight into his work. “It made me think about making records differently,” he says. “At first I felt out of my element because you have to learn the language and the science of making a record. It’s a real process to get to the point where it doesn’t sound like it’s a process. We worked at making it breathe”.
