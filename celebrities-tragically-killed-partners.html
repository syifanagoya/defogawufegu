As <a href=#>The Wrap</a> reported,&nbsp;LAPD and a&nbsp;SWAT team were called to an apartment building after gunshots were heard. The couple was found dead inside. Hayes, who had been a business associate of boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., died by suicide. 50 Cent later claimed that Mayweather had been directly involved in the couple's split and Moseley's murder. "Tell everybody why you was on FaceTime when he killed Stephanie and himself. Because he was confronting you about f***ing his wife," he wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post in July 2018.</p><p>Following Moseley's death, stars like Rihanna, Ashley Tisdale, and Jennifer Lopez expressed their heartbreak. Eva Marcille, who was a close friend, told <a href=#>ET</a>, "Stephanie was an absolute angel. She really was, to everybody she's ever met."</p><p>"We are incredibly saddened to hear the news of the passing of Stephanie Moseley," VH1 declared in a statement to The Wrap&nbsp;at the time, paying tribute to her as a member of the "Hit The Floor" family and sending their condolences to her loved ones. "She was just a huge light for us — a wonderful person," one executive producer told <a href=#>ET</a>,&nbsp;insisting that Mosely should be remembered for how she lived her life rather than her tragic death.</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampkZYJ0gY6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGStqpGctqSty6WwZqOZobmmsIypmKusnpq%2FtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-louise-fudge-mark-sheppards-wife-bio-wiki-age-disease-surgery-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Louise Fudge (Mark Sheppards Wife) Bio, Wiki, Age, Disease, Surgery, and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./derek-ramsays-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Derek Ramsay Dating Derek Ramsay's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-hey-leonardo-she-likes-me-for-me-by-blessid-union-of-souls.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me for Me) by Blessid Union of Souls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-preston-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Kelly Preston Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-kurkjian-net-worth.html>Tim Kurkjian Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./poem-of-praise-html.html>Poem of praise</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./floyd-mayweather-makes-spends-400-million-net-worth.html>How Floyd Mayweather Makes And Spends His $400 Million Personal Fortune</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
