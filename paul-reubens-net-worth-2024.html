Collaborating with fellow comedian Phil Hartman, Reubens developed the character of Pee-wee Herman, a whimsical and endearing figure that would soon capture the hearts of millions.</p><h3 id=the-snl-audition-that-changed-everything class=wp-block-heading><span id=The_SNL_Audition_That_Changed_Everything><strong>The SNL Audition That Changed Everything</strong></span></h3><p>While many may assume that Reubens’ journey to fame was smooth sailing, a significant setback occurred when he auditioned for “Saturday Night Live” (SNL) in 1980. In a twist of fate, he failed to secure a spot on the show, losing out to comic Gilbert Gottfried. However, Reubens’ determination and creative vision were unwavering.</p><p>Undeterred by the SNL rejection, Reubens borrowed $5,000 from his parents to produce his stage show at the Roxy Theater, starring none other than Pee-wee Herman.
