Welcome to the motherf***ing UFC, O’Malley. I told you motherf***ers that afro was gonna get it!"</p><p>Since earning his UFC contract five years ago, O’Malley has become one of the most recognisable faces in MMA due to his wild fashion sense and ever-changing hairstyles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/10/Screenshot-2022-10-13-164942.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/12/GettyImages-1358512698.jpg><p>The 27-year-old has also made his way into title contention at 135lbs picking up seven wins to earn a fight with former bantamweight champion <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Petr Yan</a> at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UFC 280</a> in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night.</p><p>O’Malley suffered his first and only career loss against <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marlon Vera</a> back in 2020 but he still sees himself as undefeated because the quick TKO defeat he suffered was preceded by a foot injury.</p><p>After that, he picked up three knockout wins before stepping up his opposition last time out and facing long-time contender Pedro Munhoz.</p><p>However, the fight ended inconclusively in the second round after the Brazilian fighter absorbed an accidental eye poke and was unable to continue, meaning the fight was declared a no-contest.</p><p>Despite the fact he didn’t get the win last time out, O’Malley is just one fight away from getting a shot at the UFC bantamweight title which will be on the line when Aljamain Sterling faces TJ Dillashaw this weekend in the UFC 280 co-main event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKWdlnxyfpByaHJuX6iyorqMqKSapJyaxm7BxZxka3BgYrGiusBmrqGhpJp6pLvNrZynnJWnerSx0aKcrGWjo7yxvIydpqCfXaeyoq%2FToqanZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jake-landau-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Jake Landau Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cameron-carney-died.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cameron Carney Died, West Virginia Hurricane Baseball Player Gone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-hey-leonardo-she-likes-me-for-me-by-blessid-union-of-souls.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me for Me) by Blessid Union of Souls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kelly-preston-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Kelly Preston Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tim-kurkjian-net-worth.html>Tim Kurkjian Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./poem-of-praise-html.html>Poem of praise</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./floyd-mayweather-makes-spends-400-million-net-worth.html>How Floyd Mayweather Makes And Spends His $400 Million Personal Fortune</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SkyVlog.
